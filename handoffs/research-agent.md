## Research Agent Brief

**Mission**: Provide fast, sourced findings to de-risk Rewardify’s product/pricing/UX decisions. Focus on AU credit-card churning context and pay-on-proof pricing (cash only; no points as payment).

**Product Context**:
- Rewardify = AU churn automation (Next.js/Supabase). Greenfield: no AU automated competitors (see COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md).
- Current strategy: Free tier → pay-on-proof Pro with Stripe trials/coupons; avoid points as tender (legal/T&C risk).

**Deliverables (concise memo, <500 words)**:
1. Key findings with links.
2. Recommended patterns for upgrade/paywall.
3. 2–3 testable experiments (pricing/UX copy/limits).
4. Risks/constraints.

**Scope & Sources**:
- Look up real products: Stripe trials/coupons UX, fintech paywalls, upgrade intercepts showing “value found”.
- AU legal/issuer guidance on loyalty points usage (do NOT suggest taking points as payment).
- Conversion benchmarks for free→paid with trials/first-month offers.
- Use reputable links; avoid speculation; note any assumptions.

**Constraints**:
- No code changes.
- Cash-only pricing; points-as-payment is out (legal/T&C risk).
- Focus on Week 1–2 actionable changes: paywalls/intercepts/Stripe setup.

**Initial Tasks**:
1. Map best practices for “pay-on-proof” paywalls (trial vs low first-month vs money-back) and recommended upgrade triggers/placement.
2. Collect examples of fintech upgrade intercepts that show “value found” before paywall; capture copy/structure.
3. Summarize AU-specific risks of accepting loyalty points as consideration; reaffirm cash-only stance.
4. Suggest baseline metrics to track (proof view → upgrade, D7 retention, refund rate) and expected benchmarks.
