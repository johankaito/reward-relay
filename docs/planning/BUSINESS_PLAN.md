## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The One-Liner
**"Turn every credit card into maximum rewards, automatically."**

Reward Relay is Australia's first automated credit card rewards optimization platform. We help Australians maximize credit card rewards through intelligent churning schedules, spending category optimization, and automated tracking—eliminating the manual spreadsheet work that currently defines the space.

### The Opportunity
- **Market**: 100,000+ active credit card churners in Australia
- **Problem**: Zero automated tools exist—churners use manual spreadsheets
- **Solution**: Automated tracking, optimization, and scheduling platform
- **Business Model**: Freemium SaaS ($49-99/month for Pro)
- **Path to Profitability**: $50K MRR achievable in 24 months (1,000 paying users)

### Why This Will Work (5 Whys Analysis)

**Level 1**: No competitors—greenfield opportunity
**Why no competitors?**

**Level 2**: Market perceived as too small (100K users in AU)
**Why does small market favor us?**

**Level 3**: Solo founder can dominate niche before larger players notice
**Why can we win?**

**Level 4**: Founder IS the customer—perfect product-market fit from day 1
**Why does that matter?**

**Level 5 - ROOT**: When builder = user, eliminate guesswork. Every decision validated through personal use. This creates 10x faster iteration vs building for strangers, compounding to market leadership before competition arrives.

### Target Milestones
- **Month 3**: $1K MRR (20 paying users)
- **Month 12**: $10K MRR (200 paying users)
- **Month 24**: $50K MRR (1,000 paying users) → Exit or Expand

## 1. MARKET ANALYSIS

### Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)**:
- Australia: ~10M credit card users who care about rewards
- Potential global expansion: US (50M), UK (15M), Canada (10M)

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**:
- Active churners who optimize: ~100,000 Australians
- Reward optimizers (casual): ~500,000 Australians
- Total SAM: 600K users in Australia

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**:
- Year 1 Target: 200-500 paying users (0.2%-0.5% of SAM)
- Year 2 Target: 1,000-2,000 paying users (1% of churners)
- Year 3 Target: 5,000-10,000 users (5% of churners + casual optimizers)

### Market Growth Trends

**Positive Indicators**:
1. **Inflation-Driven Optimization**: Cost of living crisis makes reward optimization more valuable
2. **Banking Profit Focus**: Banks increasingly reliant on credit card fees = more reward programs
3. **Tech-Savvy Demographics**: Millennials/Gen-Z comfortable with fintech automation
4. **Points Economy Growth**: Airlines/hotels expanding reward partnerships

**Challenges**:
1. **2025 Bank Crackdowns**: Westpac, NAB limiting repeat bonus eligibility
2. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: APRA/ASIC monitoring "bonus hunting"
3. **Economic Uncertainty**: Credit tightening could reduce card approvals

**Why Challenges Are Actually Opportunities** (5 Whys):

**Level 1**: Bank crackdowns make churning harder
**Why harder = opportunity?**

**Level 2**: Because optimization becomes MORE valuable, not less
**Why more valuable?**

**Level 3**: When rules are complex, automation provides larger advantage
**Why automation advantage?**

**Level 4**: Manual spreadsheets can't track bank-specific blacklisting rules—software can
**Why does this create moat?**

**Level 5 - ROOT**: Complexity = defensibility. Simple markets = easy competition. Complex markets (multiple banks, changing rules, blacklist tracking) = software moat. Bank crackdowns INCREASE our value prop.

- Earn 200K-500K points annually

**Pain Points**:
1. **Manual Tracking Burden**: Spreadsheet maintenance is tedious
2. **Fear of Blacklisting**: Don't know bank-specific rules
3. **Missed Opportunities**: Forget to cancel/reapply at optimal times
4. **Suboptimal Spending**: Don't maximize category bonuses
5. **Complex Rules**: Each bank has different eligibility criteria

**Willingness to Pay**:
- **High**: Saves 40+ hours/year of manual tracking
- **ROI**: If tool generates extra 50K points = $500-1,000 value
- **Price Sensitivity**: Will pay $49-99/month if clear ROI

- Unaware of category bonuses
- Leave points on table due to ignorance

**Opportunity**: Expand to this segment in Year 2 with "lite" product

---

### Customer Story #1: Founder's Use Case

**Scenario**: John needs to rotate a credit card (current card approaching optimal cancel date)

**Current Manual Process**:
1. Check spreadsheet for card history
2. Review PointsHacks for current offers
3. Calculate which bank hasn't been churned recently
4. Check bank eligibility rules manually
5. Estimate points value vs annual fee
6. Set calendar reminder for cancellation
7. Apply for new card
8. Track spending to meet minimum spend requirement
9. Set reminder for next churn date

**Time Required**: 2-3 hours per rotation

**Reward Relay Automated Process**:
1. Open app
2. See "Optimal card to apply for: AMEX Platinum (346K points, cancel ANZ by Dec 15)"
3. Click "Track Application"
4. App monitors spend automatically
5. Reminder sent at optimal cancel date

**Time Required**: 5 minutes

**Value Delivered**: 2.5 hours saved + optimized card choice = 50K more points

---

### Feature Prioritization (Why This Order)

**Why card tracker first?** (5 Whys):
- **L1**: Core pain = forgetting when to cancel/reapply
- **L2**: Because manual calendar reminders fail (life gets busy)
- **L3**: Because missed cancellations = wasted annual fees ($400-600 loss)
- **L4**: Because immediate pain (fee charged) > future benefit (points earned)
- **L5 - ROOT**: Loss aversion > gain seeking. Users will pay to AVOID losing money (fees) before they pay to GAIN money (points). Lead with loss prevention.

**Why spending optimizer second?**:
- Creates "aha moment" when users see they left 50K points on table
- Hooks them emotionally ("I need this to not waste points")
- Drives upgrade to paid tier (free tier = card tracker only)

---

---

### Revenue Projections

**Unit Economics Assumptions**:
- **ARPU** (Average Revenue Per User): $60/month (mix of $49 and $99 tiers)
- **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost): $10-20 (organic + community marketing)
- **Churn Rate**: 5% monthly (sticky due to tracking data lock-in)
- **LTV**: $1,200 (20 months average retention at $60/month)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 60:1 to 120:1 (exceptional)
- **Gross Margin**: 90%+ (SaaS)

**Revenue Milestones**:

| Milestone | Timeline | Paying Users | MRR | ARR | Notes |
|-----------|----------|--------------|-----|-----|-------|
| Validation | Month 3 | 20 | $1K | $12K | Product-market fit signal |
| Traction | Month 6 | 60 | $3.5K | $42K | Proven growth |
| Scalable | Month 12 | 200 | $12K | $144K | Sustainable business |
| Profitable | Month 18 | 500 | $30K | $360K | Solo founder profitable |
| Exit-Ready | Month 24 | 1,000 | $60K | $720K | 3-6x ARR = $2-4M exit |

**Path to $1M/Month** (Stretch Goal):
- Would require 16,000 users at $60 ARPU
- = 16% of AU churner market
- OR expansion to US/UK (10x TAM)
- Timeline: 4-5 years if AU market capped

---

### Why This Pricing Works (5 Whys)

**Level 1**: $49/month seems expensive for credit card tool
**Why will people pay?**

**Level 2**: Because ROI is 10:1 (saves $500/year in value vs $590/year cost)
**Why does ROI matter more than absolute price?**

**Level 3**: Because target customers are financial optimizers—they calculate ROI
**Why target financials calculators?**

**Level 4**: Because they're already churning (earning 200K-500K points/year = $2-5K value)
**Why does their behavior predict willingness to pay?**

**Level 5 - ROOT**: Revealed preference > stated preference. Churners already invest 40+ hours/year manually tracking. Paying $49/month to automate 40 hours = $14/hour time value. Anyone earning $80K+ ($38/hour) will pay because their time is worth more than the subscription.

---

**Channels**:
- Google Ads (high-intent keywords: "credit card churning australia")
- Facebook/Instagram (lookalike audiences)
- YouTube pre-roll (finance channels)
- Podcast sponsorships (Australian personal finance podcasts)

**Budget Allocation**:

- Test with $5K/month ad spend
- Scale winners, kill losers

---

### Distribution Advantages (Why This Will Work)

**Advantage 1: Founder IS the Customer**
- Authentic marketing (not corporate bullshit)
- Can engage in communities without being "salesy"
- Build in public = trust

**Advantage 2: Concentrated Community**
- r/AusFinance = 100K+ members, many are churners
- PointsHacks = established distribution
- OzBargain = deal-seekers overlap with churners

**Advantage 3: Word-of-Mouth Flywheel**
- Churners are vocal (share strategies)
- Reddit posts = free marketing
- Referral program amplifies (10% recurring commission for referrers)

**Advantage 4: SEO Moat**
- Build content library while competitors don't exist
- Capture "credit card churning australia" keywords early
- Compound traffic over 24 months

---

## 7. RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Bank Crackdowns on Churning

**Probability**: 60% (already happening)
**Impact**: Could reduce market size or make churning impossible

**Mitigation**:
- Bank crackdowns make optimization MORE valuable (complex rules need automation)
- Pivot positioning: "Stay compliant with bank rules" vs "game the system"
- Expand to casual optimizers (broader market)
- Data advantage: Track which banks are cracking down, help users adapt

**Why This Actually Helps Us** (5 Whys):
- **L1**: Crackdowns make churning harder
- **L2**: Harder = more rules to track manually
- **L3**: More rules = automation more valuable
- **L4**: Competitors (manual sites) can't keep up with rule changes
- **L5 - ROOT**: Complexity = moat. We're software that adapts; they're static content that goes stale.

---

### Risk 2: Market Size Cap ($50K MRR)

**Probability**: 80% (AU market is small)
**Impact**: Can't reach $1M/month in AU alone

**Mitigation**:
- $50K MRR = $600K ARR = profitable solo founder business
- Exit opportunity: Sell to fintech ($2-4M at 3-6x ARR)
- Expansion: Launch in US/UK with 10x TAM
- Adjacent markets: Expand to general reward optimization (not just churning)

**Decision Point**:
- Month 24: If at $50K MRR, DECIDE: Exit or Expand
- Don't force expansion if AU market hasn't proved out

---

### Risk 3: Regulatory (Financial Advice Laws)

**Probability**: 20%
**Impact**: Could require licensing or shutdown

**Mitigation**:
- Position as "information tool, not financial advice"
- Disclaimer: "Speak to financial advisor before making decisions"
- Consult lawyer before launch ($1-2K cost)
- Monitor: If regulators contact, pivot immediately

---

### Risk 4: Execution (Can't Ship)

**Probability**: 30% (solo founder, multiple projects history)
**Impact**: Waste 3-6 months, learn nothing

**Mitigation**:
- **FOCUS**: Kill all other projects (Sentra, ClipCash, MLaaS)
- **Kill Criteria**: If not at $500 MRR by Month 3, STOP immediately
- **Accountability**: Public commitment (#buildinpublic on Twitter)
- **Use Founder as Customer**: Build what YOU need first

**This is THE Risk**: Not market, not competition, not regulation. YOU shipping or not shipping.

---

### Risk 5: Competition Emerges

**Probability**: 40% (if we prove market)
**Impact**: Could be out-competed by better-funded players

**Mitigation**:
- **First-Mover Advantage**: Build content moat via SEO
- **Data Moat**: Accumulate churning data points (approvals/rejections by bank)
- **Community Moat**: Become trusted name in r/AusFinance
- **Speed**: Get to $50K MRR before competition notices (12-18 months)
- **Exit Strategy**: If well-funded competitor emerges, sell to them

- Annual profit (Year 2): $936K revenue - $660K cumulative costs = **$276K profit**

---

### Year 3: Exit or Expand Decision

**Scenario A: Stay in AU Market (Mature)**
- Paid Users: 2,000 (capped by market)
- MRR: $120K
- ARR: $1.44M
- Annual Profit: $900K
- **Exit Opportunity**: Sell for $4-6M (3-4x ARR)

**Scenario B: Expand to US/UK**
- Investment: $200K (hire 2 devs for US card database)
- TAM: 10x larger (50M+ users)
- Timeline: 18 months to prove US market
- Potential: $500K-1M MRR if successful

**Decision Criteria (Month 24)**:
- If AU market at $50K+ MRR → Strong exit opportunity
- If exit offers <$3M → Expand to US
- If exit offers >$4M → Take the exit

---

### Break-Even Analysis

**Fixed Costs (Monthly)**:
- Infrastructure: $500
- Tools: $200
- Total: $700/month

**Break-Even Point**: 12 paying users ($700 / $60 ARPU)

**Timeline to Break-Even**: Month 3 (20 paying users target)

**Safety Margin**: Extremely safe—only need 12 users to cover costs

### Decision Gates (Persist / Pivot / Kill)

**Month 3 Gate: VALIDATION**
- ✅ **Persist** if: $500-1K MRR (15-20 paying users)
- ⚠️ **Analyze** if: $200-500 MRR (5-15 paying users) → Why low conversion?

---

### What Could Make Us Stop (Kill Criteria)

**Hard Stops**:
1. Regulatory ban on service
2. Banks successfully kill churning entirely
3. Month 3 validation fails (<$500 MRR)
4. Month 6 still no traction (<$1K MRR)

**Soft Pivots**:
1. Churners not paying → Pivot to casual reward optimizers (broader market)
2. AU market too small → Expand to US/UK
3. SaaS model failing → Pivot to affiliate-only model

## 11. YOUR ROLE AS CUSTOMER #1

### Why This Matters (5 Whys)

**Level 1**: You need to rotate a card now
**Why does personal need matter?**

**Level 2**: Because you'll build exactly what YOU need
**Why does that help the business?**

**Level 3**: Because if it solves YOUR problem, it solves problem for others like you
**Why does "like you" matter?**

**Level 4**: Because best customers are people similar to founder (psychographics, behavior)
**Why does this create advantage?**

**Level 5 - ROOT**: Product-market fit = product solves problem for reachable customers. When founder = customer, founder knows: (1) problem deeply, (2) solution intuitively, (3) where customers are, (4) how they talk. This 4x advantage compounds to market leadership.

---

### Your Use Case (To Document in CUSTOMER_STORY_001.md)

**Current Situation**:
- Need to rotate a card soon
- Must research which card to get
- Must check eligibility with multiple banks
- Must compare offers manually
- Must track new card in spreadsheet

**Questions to Answer** (I'll create template):
1. Which card are you cancelling?
2. Why are you cancelling now?
3. How do you currently decide which card to get next?
4. What's the most annoying part of this process?
5. How long does this research usually take?
6. What would make this 10x easier?

**Goal**: Document this experience → Use it to prioritize MVP features → Validate with other churners

---

### The Commitment

**To succeed, you must**:
1. ❌ STOP Sentra, ClipCash, MLaaS (kill all other projects)
2. ✅ BUILD Reward Relay exclusively for 90 days
3. 📊 MEASURE progress weekly (MRR, users, activation)
4. 🔪 KILL if Month 3 validation fails (<$500 MRR)
5. 🚀 SCALE if validation succeeds (double down)

**This isn't a maybe. It's an all-in bet for 90 days.**

Are you ready?

## APPENDIX: PLANNING HISTORY & EVOLUTION

This business plan represents the culmination of thinking that began in November 2024.

**Earlier Planning Documents** (Archived):
- `docs/archive/early-plan-nov-2024.md` - Original 6-week execution plan (Nov 9, 2024)
- `docs/archive/early-review-nov-2024.md` - Review of early plan (Nov 9, 2024)

**Evolution Analysis**:
See [docs/EVOLUTION.md](./docs/EVOLUTION.md) for detailed analysis of how the plan evolved from November → December.

**Key Improvements**:
- Market research validated greenfield opportunity (zero AU competitors)
- Pricing increased to $49-99/mo (from $39-79/mo) based on value analysis
- Timeline extended to 8 weeks (from 6 weeks) for more realistic pacing
- Added decision gates with explicit kill criteria
- Deferred AI onboarding wizard in favor of core automation
- Added comprehensive competitive analysis and financial projections

**Why This Version is Canonical**:
- Based on actual market research (web searches confirmed no competitors)
- More realistic timelines and conservative projections
- Explicit risk management and kill criteria
- Stronger founder-market fit emphasis (build for self first)

The earlier documents are preserved for reference but this business plan supersedes them.
