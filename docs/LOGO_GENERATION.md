- **Format**: SVG (vector, scalable)
- **Style**: Minimal, modern, professional fintech

### Brand Identity
- **Industry**: Australian credit card churning / rewards optimization
- **Values**: Optimization, growth, intelligence, trustworthy
- **Aesthetic**: Tech startup, clean, data-driven

### Design Constraints
- ❌ **Avoid**: Too many elements, busy designs, complex illustrations
- ✅ **Goal**: Simple, memorable, scalable, works at 16x16px

## 📝 Iteration History

### Round 1: Initial Complex Designs (❌ Too Busy)

**Prompt Used**:
```
Modern minimalist logo for credit card rewards optimization platform. Abstract symbol combining credit card and upward arrow/growth chart. Teal (#14b8a6) to cyan (#06b6d4) gradient. Clean geometric shapes, negative space, tech startup aesthetic. Scalable for web and mobile. Professional, trustworthy, Australian fintech.
```

**Results**:
- Generated two variations with credit card + chart + arrow
- **Feedback**: "There's a lot going on in them" - too complex
- **Issues**: Multiple elements (card icon, EMV chip, bar charts, arrows, speed lines)
- **Problem**: Won't scale well to small sizes, too detailed

**Learning**: Need radical simplification - one primary element only

---

### Round 2: Simplified Concepts (🔄 In Progress)

**Design Philosophy Shift**:
- Remove literal card illustrations
- Focus on abstract symbols
- Maximum negative space
- Single element focus

**Refined Prompts to Try**:

#### **Option 1: Clean Card + Simple Arrow** (RECOMMENDED)
```
Minimalist logo: single credit card silhouette with one bold diagonal arrow across it. Teal to cyan gradient. Flat design, geometric, clean lines. No texture, no speed lines. Icon only, maximum simplicity. Modern fintech.
```

**Why this works**: Combines two core concepts (card + growth) with minimal elements

#### **Option 2: Card in Hexagon (Simplified)**
```
Simple hexagonal badge with credit card icon inside. Solid teal color, minimal detail. Clean geometric design. No speed lines, no network patterns. Flat, modern, scalable icon.
```

**Why this works**: Hexagon provides strong geometric container, card is simplified

#### **Option 3: Abstract Card Shape**
```
Minimalist rectangular logo with rounded corners suggesting credit card. Single upward chevron or arrow element. Teal-cyan gradient. Ultra clean, geometric, no details. Pure symbol.
```

**Why this works**: Most abstract - card shape implied, not illustrated

#### **Option 4: Stacked Cards Minimal**
```
Simple logo: two overlapping credit card rectangles suggesting relay/transfer. Teal gradient. Minimal, flat design, geometric. No chip details, no text. Clean icon only.
```

**Why this works**: "Relay" concept visualized through card handoff/transfer

#### **Option 5: Card + 3 Dots Flow**
```
Minimalist credit card outline with three small dots flowing from it, suggesting optimization path. Teal monochrome. Ultra clean, simple, geometric. Maximum negative space.
```

**Why this works**: Minimal motion element (dots) + card recognition

---

## 🎨 Alternative Approaches (Ultra Abstract)

If card imagery proves too complex, consider pure abstract symbols:

### **Option A: Upward Motion Only**
```
Abstract minimal logo: three ascending lines or dots suggesting growth and progression. Teal-cyan gradient. Ultra clean, geometric. Icon only, no card imagery. Maximum simplicity.
```

### **Option B: Circular Flow/Relay**
```
Minimal circular logo mark suggesting relay or flow. Two curved elements forming circle, teal-cyan gradient. Abstract, geometric, modern. No literal imagery, pure symbol. Very clean.
```

### **Option C: Letter Mark (R)**
```
Modern geometric letter R logo. Rounded corners, gradient from teal to cyan. Minimal, bold, tech startup style. Single letterform, scalable icon.
```

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

When reviewing generated logos, check:

1. **✅ Scalability Test**: Does it work at 16x16px? Can you recognize it?
2. **✅ Simplicity Test**: Can you describe it in 5 words or less?
3. **✅ Memory Test**: Would you remember it after seeing it once?
4. **✅ Versatility Test**: Works on light and dark backgrounds?
5. **✅ Brand Fit**: Feels professional, trustworthy, tech-forward?
6. **✅ Uniqueness**: Doesn't look generic or like competitors?

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Try Round 2 Prompts**: Generate with simplified prompts above
2. **Pick Top 3**: Choose best 3 variations
3. **Test at Multiple Sizes**:
   - 16x16px (favicon)
   - 32x32px (header)
   - 180x180px (app icon)
   - 512x512px (social media)
4. **Export SVG**: Download vector format from Recraft.ai
5. **Replace Logo**: Update `app/public/logo.svg`
6. **Generate Variants**: Create favicon, app icon sizes if needed

## 📁 File Locations

Once logo is finalized:

```
app/public/
├── logo.svg              # Main logo (current placeholder)
├── favicon.ico           # Browser tab icon (16x16, 32x32)
├── apple-touch-icon.png  # iOS home screen (180x180)
└── og-image.png          # Social media preview (1200x630)
```

## 💡 Design Inspiration

**Good Examples** (from user feedback):
- Image #2: Clean card shape, but too many speed lines
- Simplified card silhouettes work better than detailed illustrations

**Reference Brands** (for simplicity):
- Stripe: Simple geometric shapes
- Square: Literal but minimal
- Revolut: Clean letter mark with symbol

## ✅ Success Criteria

Logo will be considered "done" when:
- Works clearly at 32x32px header size
- User approves design
- SVG exported and tested
- All size variants generated
- Deployed to production
