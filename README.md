# REWARDIFY
**Turn every credit card into maximum rewards, automatically.**

Australian credit card rewards optimization platform for churners.

---

## PROJECT STATUS

**Current Phase**: 📋 **Business Planning**
**Launch Target**: Week 8 (Beta)
**Business Model**: Freemium SaaS ($49-99/month)
**Target Market**: 100,000+ Australian credit card churners

---

## WHAT IS REWARDIFY?

Reward Relay automates credit card churning for Australians. We track your cards, remind you when to cancel, recommend which card to apply for next, and optimize every dollar you spend.

**The Problem**:
Australian churners manually track credit cards in spreadsheets, forget optimal cancel dates, and miss opportunities. Zero automated tools exist in the AU market.

**The Solution**:
Automated tracking, intelligent recommendations, and optimization—eliminating the manual spreadsheet work.

**Why This Exists**:
Founder (John Keto) is a churner who got tired of manual tracking and built this for himself. If it solves his problem, it solves the problem for 100,000 other Australian churners.

## WHY THIS WILL WORK

### Reason 1: Greenfield Opportunity
- Zero competitors with automation in AU
- 100K active churners with no solution
- Clear, validated demand

### Reason 2: Perfect Founder-Market Fit
- Founder IS the customer (instant validation loop)
- Can authentically engage in communities
- Building for self = building for others like self

### Reason 3: Capital Efficient
- Low costs ($700/month to operate)
- Organic distribution (Reddit, communities)
- 90-day validation window (fast feedback)

### Reason 4: Risk-Managed
- Clear kill criteria (Month 3: <$500 MRR = STOP)
- Small market is feature, not bug (niche dominance)
- Multiple exit paths (sell $3-6M or expand US/UK)

### Reason 5: Solo Founder Can Ship This
- 8-week MVP build timeline
- Tech stack: Next.js + Supabase (founder knows)
- No team required until $50K+ MRR

---

## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Bank Crackdowns
**Impact**: Banks limit churning
**Mitigation**: Crackdowns make optimization MORE valuable (complexity = moat)

### Risk 2: Market Size Cap
**Impact**: AU market caps at $50K MRR
**Mitigation**: $50K MRR = profitable → Exit or expand US/UK

### Risk 3: Regulatory
**Impact**: Financial advice laws
**Mitigation**: "Information only" disclaimer + lawyer review

### Risk 4: Execution (Founder Can't Ship)
**Impact**: Waste 3-6 months
**Mitigation**: Focus (kill all other projects), kill criteria (Month 3), public accountability

### Risk 5: Competition Emerges
**Impact**: Funded startup enters market
**Mitigation**: First-mover advantage, data moat, exit strategy

### Next 90 Days
- **Weeks 1-4**: Build Phase 1 (core tracking)

### Decision Point (Day 90)

## COMMITMENT

**To succeed, founder must**:
1. ❌ **STOP** Sentra, ClipCash, MLaaS (kill all other projects)
2. ✅ **BUILD** Reward Relay exclusively for 90 days
3. 📊 **MEASURE** progress weekly (MRR, users, activation)
4. 🔪 **KILL** if Month 3 validation fails (<$500 MRR)
5. 🚀 **SCALE** if validation succeeds (double down)

**This isn't a maybe. It's an all-in bet for 90 days.**

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Why Reward Relay vs just using PointsHacks?
**A**: PointsHacks is content/education. Reward Relay is automation/execution. They're complementary (we may partner).

### Q: Why would people pay $49/month for this?
**A**: Time savings (40 hours/year) + optimized earnings (50K+ extra points = $500-1,000 value) = ROI of 10:1.

### Q: What if banks kill churning entirely?
**A**: Unlikely (banks profit from churners who miss cancel dates). But if they do, pivot to general reward optimization (broader market).

### Q: Can you reach $1M/month in Australia?
**A**: No—AU market caps at ~$50K MRR. Would need US/UK expansion. But $50K MRR = $600K ARR = profitable business + exit opportunity.

### Q: Why not build mobile app first?
**A**: Web-first is faster to build and iterate. Can add mobile later if traction proven.

### Q: What about bank account integration?
**A**: Too risky (legal, security) and slow to build for MVP. Manual entry + CSV upload is sufficient for validation.
